# Seasonal Precipitation Predictability (SPP)

## Description
This code calculates the predictability of seasonal precipitation over land from sea surface temperature (SST). The SPP during each season is assessed by the predictive skill of the best linear predictive model using as predictors the leading modes of global SSTs (using EOF analysis) in the 3-month preceding season.
